# Spaceship Titanic - Kaggle Competition

![Spaceship Titanic](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-competitions/kaggle/31349/logos/header.png?t=2021-10-07-00-46-21)

## Project Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for my participation in the [Spaceship Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/spaceship-titanic) competition hosted on Kaggle. The objective of this competition is to predict which passengers were transported to an alternate dimension during the SpaceShip Titanic's fateful voyage.

### Folder Descriptions

- **env/**: This directory contains the virtual environment setup for the project. It ensures that all dependencies are managed and can be easily replicated.
  
- **input/**: This folder contains the raw dataset files downloaded from the Kaggle competition page.

- **models/**: This directory stores the saved models, including any serialized versions of the trained models (e.g., `.pkl` files).

- **notebooks/**: This folder includes all Jupyter notebooks used for exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

- **src/**: This directory contains Python scripts that perform data processing, feature engineering, and model training.

- **.gitignore**: This file specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Git (e.g., the virtual environment, dataset files, etc.).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have Python installed on your system. It is recommended to use a virtual environment for managing dependencies. To set up the virtual environment, run the following commands:

```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Data

The data for this project can be downloaded from the Kaggle competition page [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/spaceship-titanic/data). Once downloaded, place the data files in the `input/` directory.

### Running the Code

Start by exploring the data and initial model training using the provided Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory. For example:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/eda.ipynb
```

You can also run the scripts in the `src/` directory for processing the data and training the models.

## Methodology

The project follows a systematic approach:

1. **Data Exploration and Cleaning**: Initial analysis of the data to understand its structure and identify any issues such as missing values or outliers.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Generating new features that might improve the model's ability to make accurate predictions.
3. **Model Selection and Training**: Trying out different machine learning algorithms and selecting the most promising model based on performance metrics.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Using cross-validation and other techniques to assess the model's performance.
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tuning the model to achieve the best possible performance.
6. **Final Model**: Saving the final model for submission and further analysis.

## Results

This section will be updated with results and insights as the project progresses.
